**How to use the Serverless Framework to get PHP working in AWS Lambda with an
experience that closely mimics native languages**

As a full-time PHP developer that’s been following the serverless movement for
quite some time, I’ve been stuck without an outlet to take advantage of
Functions as a Service (FaaS).

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is the best known FaaS platform
which supports a number of native languages — but poor old PHP is not amongst
them (yet). AWS has published several [articles on how to take advantage of
other non-native scripting
languages](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/scripting-languages-for-aws-lambda-running-php-ruby-and-go/)
such as PHP, but those solutions lack the power provided by the native
languages.

Why PHP, you ask? Well for someone who works with PHP daily, being able to work
with the familiar tools and languages is a huge boost to productivity. While
Node or Python might provide better performance at runtime, getting something up
and running in a familiar place is very valuable — especially when you can’t
spare the hours to invest in learning a new language and evaluate new testing
frameworks.

If you’ve been hunting around this area like me, you’ve no doubt come across
Robert Anderson’s (Zerosharp)
[blog](http://blog.zerosharp.com/the-serverless-framework-and-php/) and
[repo](https://github.com/ZeroSharp/serverless-php) which gets a very simple
framework going with PHP and [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/).
This was my starting point and inspiration.

#### The Goal

The principle goal here is to get PHP working in AWS Lambda with an experience
as close as possible to the native languages. The hope is that if AWS add PHP as
an official language in future then the porting will be a very straight forward
process.

Simple “Hello World” performance should be within the realms of what we would
expect from a more standard Nginx/FPM stack, although we can clearly expect some
overhead from needing to shim PHP.

#### Building the Shim

Like the original Zerosharp implementation, we will use Node as the entry point
in order to get our PHP instance running and Serverless Framework to do all the
heavy lifting for us. Make sure you have [Serverless
installed](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
(I’m using Node 6.2 and Serverless 1.10).

    serverless install --url 

The GitHub repository can be found
[here](https://github.com/araines/serverless-php/tree/v0.1.0) (version 0.1.0
used in this article).

The principle of the shim is this:

* Use `argv` for passing the event object from Node to PHP
* Use `stdout` for passing output from PHP to Node
* Use `stderr` for passing log lines from PHP to Node
* Pass environment variables through to PHP for full access
* JSON is used as the common messaging format to interface the languages

For those familiar with Symfony components, the PHP entry point may be familiar.
It sets up a service container, loading the services from `config/services.yml`
in the usual manner. The event object is grabbed from `argv` and returned to
native PHP array form. Then the environment variable `HANDLER` is used to find
the appropriate service from the container, the service is called and the return
value is passed back via `stdout` after being JSON encoded.

#### Building your Handler

Create a new class which implements the `Handler` interface:

```php
<?php
namespace Raines\Serverless;

class ExampleHandler implements Handler
{
    public function handle(array $event)
    {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

Set up a new service within `config/services.yml` with an appropriate name. If
you are unfamiliar with the Symfony Service Container, you can read more about
it [here](http://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html).

```yaml
services:
  handler.example:
    class: Raines\Serverless\ExampleHandler
```

Finally add the new function to the `serverless.yml` :

```yaml
functions:
  example:
    handler: handler.handle     # Always handler.handle
    environment:
      HANDLER: handler.example  # The name of your service
```

#### The Performance of PHP

For those unfamiliar with Lambda, there is no way to select how much CPU power
you would like for your function directly. Instead, you select how much memory
you want and the CPU scales with that. There are also cold- and warm-starts
which we have to contend with.

> In the AWS Lambda resource model, you choose the amount of memory you want for
> your function, and are allocated proportional CPU power and other resources. For
example, choosing 256MB of memory allocates approximately twice as much CPU
power to your Lambda function as requesting 128MB of memory and half as much CPU
power as choosing 512MB of memory. You can set your memory in 64MB increments
from 128MB to 1.5GB.

If you want some seriously in-depth analysis on Lambda performance, [Robert
Vojta](https://medium.com/@robertvojta) published an interesting
[post](https://robertvojta.com/aws-journey-api-gateway-lambda-vpc-performance-452c6932093b).
I’m not going to do anything that complex here, and I recommend you benchmark
your own solutions once written to determine what works best for your use-case.

I’ve tested a simple Hello World function with various memory sizes here for
comparison. The durations here are real-world, i.e. I’m calling the function via
API Gateway from an EC2 instance, both running in the same region. The figures
here are averaged over multiple executions once the function has been warmed.

From my limited testing, it appears that you get very consistent performance
from Node (for very simple tasks) regardless of memory. However, for PHP the
performance only starts to approach that of Node around 512MB-768MB. At this
stage you pay approximately a 20ms penalty for using PHP, which I think is
reasonable.

Another element worth considering is how you bundle and package your function.
Whilst developing, you’ll inevitably want the dev tools installed with
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), but for production they aren’t necessary.
In fact, the fewer packages you can bundle, the better. You also want to ensure
you have an optimised autoloader for production as it provides a fairly
significant improvement.

#### Adding Context to Serverless PHP

One of the missing features of my initial implementation of a PHP shim for
Serverless Framework was access to the Lambda context object. The context object
is passed as the second parameter in native languages which gives you access to
information available from Lambda.

The most useful thing available is the ability find the execution time remaining
before AWS Lambda terminates your Lambda function. This is also the most
challenging piece to get right as it requires two-way communication between PHP
and Node.

> The codebase can be found
> [here](https://github.com/araines/serverless-php/tree/v0.2.0) (v0.2.0).

#### Implementing the cross-language function call

I got this working by using an additional file descriptor for communication
between Node and PHP (file descriptor 3). Here is the extract where the magic
happens on the Node side of things:

```javascript
// Request for remaining time from context
proc.stdio[3].on('data', function (data) {
  var remaining = context.getRemainingTimeInMillis();
  proc.stdio[3].write(`${remaining}\n`);
});
```

This ensures that as soon as we get any data through on FD3 we ask the real
context object for the remaining time, then respond back on the same stream
terminated with a new line character. The PHP side of things looks a bit like
this:

```javascript
$fd = fopen('php://fd/3', 'r+');

public function getRemainingTimeInMillis() : int
{
  fwrite($this->fd, 'x');

return (int) fgets($this->fd);
}
```

It writes a single meaningless character to the stream to trigger the response
from Node and then reads up until the newline character, completing the remote
function call.

#### Performance Implications

Given that we are passing information back and forth between the two runtimes,
there is going to be some overhead involved. Using a local execution environment
I measured the time taken to execute the `getRemainingTimeInMillis()` both
natively within Node and via the PHP remote call.

Whilst setting up the testing I noticed that the initial execution time in PHP
was very slow, but then subsequent calls would be fast. So I’ve broken the
timings out to allow for both.

* **Node** first execution: 0.066ms, subsequent execution: 0.055ms
* **PHP** first execution: 1.504ms, subsequent execution: 0.045ms

Clearly the first execution is quite expensive in PHP, however the subsequent
executions appear to have no measurable overhead. This is great news if you need
to have a loop where this value is checked regularly.

#### Limitations and Future Work

PHP typically runs within a request/response environment with the superglobals
set and ready to go by PHP-FPM, Apache, or something similar. It would be an
interesting project to setup a similar environment that uses PHP and associated
frameworks (e.g. Symfony, Laravel) as if you were running with a real webserver
— when in reality a combination of API Gateway and Lambda provide the
infrastructure.

It would also be great to package some of the common tasks in a Serverless
plugin. For example, running composer with the right flags during deployment.
