In early December 2018 whilst I was out in Sofia I gave a talk to a meetup held
at [Questers][questers] around some of the tech stack I'm now involved with at
[News UK][newsuk].

The idea behind the talk was to get more people aware of, and interested in,
[GraphQL][graphql] and [React Native][reactnative]. As such, this talk serves
as an introduction to those technologies, some of the reasoning why we are
using them and a few examples of our experiences along the way.

I was completely unaware that this would even find its way on to the net, so
imagine my surprise when it showed up featured in [GraphQL
Weekly][graphqlweekly]!

You can find a recording of my talk on [youtube][youtube] and is the middle
of three from that night, between 12:01 and 40:24.
