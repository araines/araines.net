title: Blog rewrite

excerpt:  I've been meaning to do something about this for a while, so I've picked up Vercel, Next.js and MDX.

The previous version of my blog was hosted on GitHub Pages, using Jekyll in a [pretty standard setup][github-jekyll].  I was reasonably satisfied with it.  I got it up and running pretty quickly using a lightly modified version of [Minimal Mistakes][mmistakes], and it was very easy to add new posts as it is all just markdown.

However, I was hitting a few problems which I'd been meaning to address for some time.  Firstly was that I'm not super familiar with Ruby, and every time I try to do something with it I seem to eventually run in to a mess with conflicting Gems which makes keeping things up to date and well maintained more difficult.  I did manage to break some of the look-and-feel of the site at some point through doing some upgrades and then not being able to mimic how it used to be.  Not deal-breakers, just minor inconveniences.

I'll be the first to admit, front-end/web development is not my strong suit.  I am far more comfortable on the backend, working with APIs and databases.  Whenever I am faced with having to deal with CSS I'll put it off, particularly for personal projects when it's not totally broken.  As such I'd never really played properly with React, or some other cool stuff I'd seen kicking around like [Next.js][nextjs] and [Vercel][vercel].  I'd been meaning to fix up my personal blog for months, so this looked like a good excuse to try some of these things out.
